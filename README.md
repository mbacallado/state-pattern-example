# State Pattern – Design Patterns in Practice (2015)

This repository contains a **simple and functional implementation of the State Pattern**, one of the classic design patterns in software engineering.

It is intended as an **educational example** to help developers understand how to separate state-specific logic and transition handling in a clean, maintainable way.

📄 This repository includes the full presentation on the State Pattern in PDF format, available [here](./StatePattern_ManuelAlejandroBacalladoLópez.pdf).

## 🎯 Purpose

To demonstrate how the **State Pattern** can be implemented to manage behavior changes in objects based on their current state, without using large conditional statements.

---

## 📚 What is the State Pattern?

The State Pattern is a **behavioral design pattern** that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class at runtime.

**Key benefits:**
- Eliminates complex conditional logic.
- Encapsulates state-specific behavior.
- Makes the code easier to maintain and extend.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies used

- Java.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
- State Design Pattern.

---

## 🧪 Features demonstrated
- ✅ Implementation of the State Pattern in Java.
- ✅ Encapsulation of state-specific behavior.
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns.
- ✅ Easy to extend with new states.
- ✅ Minimal, easy-to-follow example for learning purposes.
